# Last.fm API Wrapper for Appcelerator Titanium Apps

The JavaScript last.fm API allows you to call last.fm API methods and get the
corresponding JSON responses. Basically it just acts as a wrapper that gives
easy access to API methods. 


## Usage

* Include lastfm.api.js
`Titanium.include('last.fm-api-for-titanium/lastfm.api.js');

* more to come... as this is all quite way-pre-mega-super-alpha at the moment.
